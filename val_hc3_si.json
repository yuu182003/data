{"text": "Engineering multinational, Arup, has released a report entitled “It’s Alive,” which explores how urban buildings could look by 2050 &ndash; essentially functional living organisms, that are constantly changing to respond to environmental changes and user demands. It predicts structures that are fully integrated into the fabric of a city, able to respond to external environment changes and designed for continuous adaptability. There are predictions of jet-powered maintenance robots, high-rise farms, and photovoltaic paint, all of which are already in development. The predictions include modular skyscrapers that are maintained by drones, are fuel efficient thanks to algae fuel cells and have a brain-like “intelligent building system” that can make automatic adjustments to the needs of the inhabitants to deliver more resources than they consume.", "label": 1}
