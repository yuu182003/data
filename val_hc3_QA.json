{"text": "The teasing began in grade school for me about my natural hair . Being mixed , my hair does grow very long without the need of many products . Caucasian , Asian and Latino kids would constantly tease me about my curls . I wanted to look like the girls on TV and magazines . Even black women had straight hair . It made me believe that mine really was nt acceptable or normal . I really believed I was nappy headed when looking back , my hair was beautiful . By the time I was 14 , I decided to go behind my mothers back and do something about it . I relaxed it , flat ironed it and cut it . I stopped getting made fun of so much and began to fit in better . After years of abusing my hair , I had to continue to cut it , relax it and straighten it . Suddenly it stopped growing out as beautifully . When I turned 21 , I decided I needed a weave to take stress of relaxers and chemicals off of it for a while . I did that until it grew out naturally . Now I appreciate my hair and wear it naturally every day . Not everyone 's story is like mine as many black women are taught their hair is \" bad \" from the start of life instead of I guess , realizing it on their own like I did .", "label": 0}
{"text": "Hi,Thanks  for  your query.From your symptoms, it seems that you are suffering from plantar fasciitis. It happens due to inflammation of the plantar fascia.It hurts the most with the first few steps in the morning because the plantar fascia is tight and has not stretched out yet, and throughout the day it loosens up. The best thing you can do is when you wake up in the morning, before getting out of bed and taking a step, give yourself a little foot rub.There are many things you can try to help your foot get better:Give your feet a rest. Cut back on activities that make your feet hurt. Try not to walk or run on hard surfaces.Use shoes with good arch support and a cushioned sole.Do toe stretches, calf stretches and towel stretches several times a day, especially when you first get up in the morning.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care", "label": 0}
{"text": "There could be a few reasons why you might feel grumpy or have a headache after napping in the late afternoon. One possibility is that you are experiencing something called \"sleep inertia,\" which is the grogginess and disorientation that can occur after waking up from sleep. This can be more pronounced after waking up from a deep sleep or after a longer nap, and it can cause symptoms like headache, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. Another possibility is that your nap is disrupting your natural sleep-wake cycle, which could make it harder for you to fall asleep at night and leave you feeling tired and irritable during the day. It's also possible that you are experiencing other underlying health issues or stressors that are causing these symptoms. I would recommend trying to stick to a consistent sleep schedule, getting plenty of natural light during the day, and avoiding screens before bedtime to help regulate your sleep-wake cycle and improve your overall sleep quality.", "label": 1}

{"text": "A compound fracture, also known as an open fracture, is a type of broken bone in which the bone has broken through the skin. This type of fracture is considered a medical emergency because it carries a higher risk of infection.The treatment for a compound fracture typically involves the following steps:Control bleeding: If the bone has punctured the skin, there may be significant bleeding. The first priority is to control the bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound and elevating the injured limb above heart level, if possible.Administer pain medication: The patient will likely be given pain medication to help manage the pain associated with the fracture.Clean the wound: The wound will need to be thoroughly cleaned to reduce the risk of infection. This may involve using a sterile solution or irrigation to clean out any debris or dirt.Set the bone: Once the wound has been cleaned and the bleeding has been controlled, the bone will need to be set back into place. This may be done using traction, splinting, or surgery.Close the wound: If the wound is small, it may be closed using sutures (stitches). If the wound is larger or if there is significant tissue damage, the wound may need to be left open and allowed to heal on its own.Rehabilitation: After the bone has been set and the wound has been closed, the patient will likely need to undergo physical therapy to help restore strength and mobility to the injured limb.It's important to seek medical treatment as soon as possible for a compound fracture. If left untreated, this type of fracture can lead to serious complications, such as infection, nerve damage, or amputation.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Neon Genesis Evangelion is a complex and psychological anime series that explores themes of identity, relationships, and the human condition. It follows the story of a teenage boy named Shinji, who is recruited by his father to pilot a giant bio-machine called an \"Evangelion\" to fight mysterious creatures called Angels that are threatening to destroy humanity. As Shinji struggles to come to terms with his role as a pilot and his relationships with other characters, he must also grapple with deep personal issues, such as feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. The series is known for its dense and symbolic storytelling, which can be difficult to fully understand on a single viewing. One key aspect of the series that may be confusing is the concept of the \"Inner Sphere,\" which represents the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters. The series often uses surreal imagery and symbolism to depict the Inner Sphere and explore the psychological states of the characters. Another aspect that may be confusing is the role of the Angels, who are depicted as both enemies and symbols of personal growth. The Angels represent various aspects of the human psyche and often represent the characters' inner conflicts and desires. Overall, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a highly complex and thought-provoking series that explores deep and philosophical themes. If you're having trouble understanding it, you may want to consider re-watching it or looking up more information online to get a better understanding of the series.", "label": 1}

It an include different levels of coverage for different people . Again , this is rare . 3 : Single payer is not \" socialist \" . It can be , but it 's not automatically . 4 : The single payer operates both ways . It 's the single point where money ENTERS the system , and it 's the single point money LEAVES the system . OK . So lets pretend we have \" American System \" and a single payer system , call it DoktorCo . In America , you will have 2 - 4 different health insurance companies where you are . Lets say there are 3 of them , and they all have equal amounts of business . So if we spend $ 30,000 , they each get $ 10,000 . We can call them Aetna , Blue Cross , and Cigna ( A , B and C ! ) When you use medical services , your insurance pays . So the doctor sends a bill to A. A then has their people review the paperwork , and then sends money to the doctor . Now I see the same doctor . I 'm with B ... so he has to do DIFFERENT paperwork , and send it to B , who has different people process it . He might also get paid a different amount ... Now Chuck , who uses C , wants to see the doctor . But our doctor does n't accept C ! Chuck has to go see Doc Zed instead . That 's annoying . That 's the most basic version . Compared to DoktorCo . Everyone pays DoktorCo . So they get all $ 30,000 . They only have one set of clerks to handle this ( instead of A B and C having 3 sets ) . Every doctor is paid by them . They always get the same amount . No matter who sees them , they only need to use one set of papers , and only one set of clerks to process it . Everything is always the same for every patient . It 's a lot simpler . --------- The biggest benefit to single payer is efficiency . They need less people to do the same work , so less money is wasted . You do n't duplicate services . You only need one way to make claims , not different ones for every company . A very important savings is that they do n't need to compete . Aetna , for instance , spends a LOT of money on advertising to convince everyone with Blue Cross to pick Aetna instead .

When you chew mint gum or eat a mint, the menthol in the mint activates temperature-sensitive receptors in your mouth, which can make you feel like the water is colder than it actually is.It's important to note that the water itself isn't actually getting colder when you eat mint. The menthol in the mint is simply tricking your brain into thinking that the water is colder than it really is. It's a similar effect to how eating spicy food can make you feel like your mouth is on fire, even though the food itself isn't hot.So, in short, mint doesn't actually make water colder, but it can make you feel like it is because of the menthol's cooling effect on your mouth.", "label": 1}

A long time ago ( probably around the time of the ancient Egyptians , from what historians can tell ) , people realized that there was something kind of special about pigeons . Most pigeons spent a lot of their time around there \" home area \" where their nests and their mates were . And , when they went somewhere else , they were really good at finding their way back home . When people realized that these birds were inclined to return home and also good at it , they realized they could use these wild birds if they domesticated them . So they started selectively breeding them . They picked the birds that were the best at finding their way home and bred them so their babies would be even better at it . They also bred them to be comfortable around humans . What they ended up with is what we call a homing pigeon . A homing pigeon can find its way home from a way further distance than a wild pigeon can , and it does it pretty much any time it 's free and it 's not at its home . So what people can do is raise a bunch of homing pigeons in one place , and then anybody who might need to send messages to that place in the future could take some of the homing pigeons with them wherever they were going . They keep the pigeons in cages , and when it 's time to send a message , they tie the message to the pigeon 's leg and let it free . It flies home , delivering the message in the process . So , as you see , for someone to send you a message by pigeon they need to have one of your pigeons in captivity first , because your pigeons always want to fly back to your house .

{"text": "Clouds are created when moist air rises and cools. As the air cools, the water vapor in it condenses into liquid water or ice crystals, which form clouds. This process is called condensation.There are several factors that can cause moist air to rise and cool, leading to cloud formation. One of the most common is the heating of the Earth's surface by the sun. As the surface warms, it heats the air above it, causing it to become less dense and rise. This rising air is often accompanied by the cooling of the air, which can lead to the condensation of water vapor and the formation of clouds.Other factors that can contribute to cloud formation include topographic features, such as mountains, which can cause moist air to rise and cool as it moves over them, and the movement of fronts, which are boundaries between different air masses that can lead to the mixing of moist and dry air, causing clouds to form.Overall, cloud formation is a complex process that depends on a variety of factors, including temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Ah yes . I can answer this in a way that will educate you on computer security , too . :-) In computers , there are two distinct and often confused concepts : authentication and authorization . Authentication , like a passport , exists to provide a way for a user to prove who they are . An authentication system does things like provide a challenge to a user that only that user ought to be able to meet , such as entering a password . Authorization , like a visa , exists to provide a way for a user to access restricted resources . A \" restricted \" resource is anything – a file , a device , etc – that is not available for everyone to use . An authorization system does things like allow some users ( administrators ) to allow or disallow access to resources by other users ( e.g. , setting permissions on a file ) . So authentication is a way of proving that a user is who they say they are , and authorization gives them access to whatever resources they should have access to . Then there is the concept of a \" role \" . A role is a way of grouping users so that permissions can be assigned to the role . Then , if you are a user in that group , you have all the privileges of the role . For example , an administrator might create a role called \" Printer Admin \" and then give all the rights to administer all printers in an organization . Now , if I come along and the administrator wants to give me the ability to help out by administering all the printers , the admin can simply add me to that role . Instead of having to set up a complex set of authorizations for each user , and then remove them when I am no longer in that role , it can be set up just once and simple associations made between users and roles . The example of this relevant to this question might be the concept of a foreign diplomat . When you are a diplomat , you get a special passport in addition to your normal one . Then , when you want to travel in the role of diplomat , you can simply present the passport that identifies you in that role rather than the one that identifies you as a normal citizen of your country .

Creationists obviously like smaller numbers , but even among secular evolutionary theorists , exactly when you start counting primates other than * homo sapiens * \" human \" is subject to some debate . * Homo habilus * is thought to be about 2.3 million years old , but * homo sapiens * proper is probably only like 100,000 to 200,000 years old at most .

Granted , things will probably take longer if you 're starting with a population that has a more - or - less uniform skin color . But even then , two people with relatively similar complexions can have a kid who is darker or lighter than either of them . Given what we do know about how rapidly skin color can change in family trees , the answer is : \" Relatively speaking , probably not very long at all , regardless of how old you think humanity is . \"", "label": 0}
{"text": "\" Grounding \" in electrical circuits just means a reference point , to which everything else can be connected . For example , in a car , one side of the battery is connected to the car 's body / chassis . This provides a convenient way to complete an electrical circuit . So , if you want to connect a headlight . You do n't need to connect 2 wires - one taking current from the battery to the bulb , and one taking the return current from the bulb to the battery . Instead , you can just use 1 wire to take current from the battery to the bulb , and the return current can go via the car 's chassis . The same principle is used in marine craft , aircraft and spacecraft . The metal structure serves as a convenient method of connecting multiple things together to allow circuits to be completed . If two spacecraft need to dock , then the bodies can be electrically connected together to form a single \" ground \" zone covering both craft . Each craft retains its own electrical system , but the two systems share the same reference point . For land based stationary applications ( buildings ) , then the ground itself ( which is electrically conductive ) can be used as a convenient reference point , and as a failsafe method of carrying current in the case of an electrical fault . The ground itself is n't a very good electrical conductor , so it is n't usually used to carry current under normal conditions for energy efficiency reasons ( but this is sometimes used in very rural areas , where a remote house or farm needs a long power line , but only a small amount of power , making it too expensive to run 2 wires on the power poles - in this case , you can just run a single wire , and use the ground as the return path ) .", "label": 0}
{"text": "It is possible that the white lumps in your baby's poop could be caused by a gastrointestinal infection, such as the gastric bug that your cousin has. However, there could be other causes as well. It is important to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the cause and determine the appropriate treatment, if necessary.Other possible causes of white lumps in the poop include the presence of undigested milk or formula, a condition known as steatorrhea (excess fat in the stool), or the presence of a foreign object.If your baby is otherwise healthy and gaining weight, it is not uncommon for them to have more frequent bowel movements, especially if they are breastfeeding. However, if you are concerned about your baby's bowel movements or if they are experiencing other symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or abdominal pain, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Cardio and weight lifting are both good for burning calories and can help with weight loss. However, they work in different ways and have different benefits. Cardio, or aerobic exercise, is any activity that gets your heart rate up and makes you breathe harder. Examples include running, cycling, and swimming. Cardio is especially good at burning calories and fat because it involves sustained, rhythmic movement that can be done for a long time. When you do cardio, your body uses energy (calories) from fat stores to fuel your muscles. Weight lifting, or resistance training, is when you lift weights or use your own body weight to work your muscles. It can be done with dumbbells, barbells, machines, or just using your own body weight (such as push-ups or squats). Weight lifting is not as good as cardio at burning calories during the actual workout, but it has other benefits. It can help you build muscle, which can boost your metabolism and help you burn more calories all day long, even when you're not working out. So, to answer your question, cardio is better at burning fat during the workout because it uses a lot of energy and can be sustained for a long time. However, weight lifting can also be helpful for weight loss because it can help you build muscle, which can help you burn more calories even when you're not working out.", "label": 1}

{"text": "In a normal case, the body absorbs water from the digestive tract as food and liquids pass through it. This helps to keep the body hydrated and maintain a healthy balance of fluids. However, when someone has diarrhea, the large intestine (also known as the colon) becomes inflamed and the muscles in the intestine contract more frequently and strongly than usual. This causes the food and liquids to pass through the intestine more quickly, which doesn't give the body enough time to absorb the water. As a result, the water passes out of the body as loose, watery stools (also known as diarrhea).In a normal case, when you go to the bathroom to pass stools, the stools are solid because the body has had enough time to absorb the water from the intestine. In contrast, when you have diarrhea, the stools are loose and watery because the body hasn't had enough time to absorb the water.I hope this helps to answer your question! Let me know if you have any other questions.", "label": 1}
{"text": "It is not currently possible for humans or any known matter to travel at the speed of light because as an object increases in speed, its mass increases exponentially. This means that an object would need an infinite amount of energy to reach the speed of light.Additionally, the laws of physics as we understand them break down at the speed of light, so it is not clear what would happen if an object were able to travel at that speed.One way to think about it is to imagine a car trying to drive on a road. The faster the car goes, the harder it is for the car to turn or change direction. It becomes harder and harder to control the car the faster it goes. Similarly, as an object approaches the speed of light, it becomes harder and harder to control and predict what will happen to it.Scientists and engineers have made attempts to try to understand and develop technologies that would allow for faster-than-light travel, but so far, all of these attempts have been unsuccessful. It is not known if it will ever be possible for humans to travel at the speed of light or faster.", "label": 1}

If the capsule aimed for the Great Lakes , and missed , it might fall on Detroit , Chicago , Toronto , and other large cities .

The odds of hitting a random cargo ship in the ocean is small , but the chance of hitting a cargo ship in the lakes is a bit higher . Secondly , there are not nearly as many recovery ships in lakes as there are in the ocean . If the capsule got lost , they could send a whole fleet of warships from many nations to find it .

{"text": "The Troubles in Ireland refer to a period of conflict that took place in Northern Ireland, which is a part of the United Kingdom, from the late 1960s to the late 1990s. The Troubles were characterized by violence and conflict between different groups in Northern Ireland, including Catholics and Protestants, Irish nationalists and unionists, and various paramilitary organizations.The root causes of the Troubles in Ireland are complex and varied, and they can be traced back to historical, political, and cultural factors that have shaped the region over many centuries. Some of the key factors that contributed to the Troubles include:The partition of Ireland in 1922, which created the independent Irish Free State in the south and Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom in the north. This division was opposed by many Irish nationalists, who wanted a united Ireland, and it led to tension and conflict between Irish nationalists and unionists, who wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom.Sectarianism, or the division of people into different religious or sectarian groups, was a significant factor in the Troubles. Northern Ireland has a long history of sectarian conflict, and the Troubles were fueled in part by tensions between Catholics and Protestants, who have often been divided along sectarian lines.Political violence and the use of paramilitary organizations by both sides played a significant role in the Troubles. Many groups, including the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), and others, carried out bombings, assassinations, and other acts of violence in an attempt to further their political goals.The Troubles in Ireland resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries, and they had a profound impact on the people and communities of Northern Ireland. The conflict was eventually brought to an end by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which established a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and provided", "label": 1}
